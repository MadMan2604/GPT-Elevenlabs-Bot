# My Elevenlabs OpenAI ChatBot

Made from scratch with the help of openai's base code for a prrivate chatbot
In order to get the speech function workingg you will need to use Mozilla TTS (as a current substitute if elevenlabs runs out) 
You will also need an OpenAi API Key and an Elevenlabs Voice Token (API Key). 
Mozilla TTS File is also located as one of the repositories in my profile for easy access. 


In the brance Elevenlabs Bot, there is a script called bot.py, that is the script for the working ElevenLabs OpenAI bot, with limited calls. 
The other scirpts are still a work in progress with a multitude of errors and bugs.
